database engine namespace
=========================

All modules in the dbengines package must implement the same given interface
(set of database functions) and agree to return the same thing. This ensures
that switching database engine becomes only a matter of switching the given
namespace. For example, a switch from sqlite3 to mariadb might look like:

before:
    from dbengines import sqlite3 as db

after:
    from dbengines import mariadb as db

therefore no code needs to be changed since we still user, for example:
    db.user_by_name(username)

everywhere to fetch a user. I find this to be less verbose then the whole 
class definition thing.
